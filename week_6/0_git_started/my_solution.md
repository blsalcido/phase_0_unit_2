## Release 5: Reflection

### Reflection
I really hated this at first but, I've known for a long time I needed to practice using git in the terminal. I hate to admit it because, and I may be alone on this, but, I really like the github app. I think it made wrapping my head around version control incredibly easy and I will miss it terribly. That said, I guess the terminal is necessary, although, I still don't fully understand why you wouldn't just use the app; it's much friendlier in my opinion. 

That being said, I'm happy to have learned how to do this the proper way and only made a few mistakes in the beginning. I ended up using the GitHub App once becasue I initially added my files incorrectly. I hated having to do that but, I didn't want to try to find my way out and end up messing everything up. It still makes me a little nervous but, I'm feeling better and better about it by the hour.
